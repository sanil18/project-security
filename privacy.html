    <p>Thank you for choosing Passcheck Protector! As the sole creator and administrator, I am committed to prioritizing your privacy and maintaining the highest standards of data security. This Privacy Policy outlines how I handle user information and emphasizes my dedication to transparency.</p>

    <h2>Information I Do Not Collect:</h2>

    <p>At Passcheck Protector, I take privacy seriously. I do not collect any personal information from users. There are no forms to fill out, and I do not use cookies or any tracking mechanisms. Your privacy is my top priority.</p>

    <h2>Data Security:</h2>

    <p>Given my commitment to cybersecurity principles, I implement industry-standard security measures to safeguard Passcheck Protector.

While I strive to link only to reputable sources, please be aware that I have no control over the content or privacy practices of external sites. I recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party websites for your assurance.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</h2>

    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect any changes in my practices or to comply with legal requirements. Any modifications will be posted on this page, and the date of the latest update will be revised accordingly.</p>
